My name is Seunghoi Kim from South Korea. 

I have graduated MEng Computer Science in June 2021 with First Class Honours and now studying my PhD in the centre for medical imging computing at University College London under the supervision of Prof. Daniel Alexander.  

What else do you need?

### My story

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
